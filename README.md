C++ Projects for SNHU
---
In these projects we were using different data structures to perform the task of viewing courses, and creating a class schedule. I feel as though the more we worked on these projects, the more I began to understand each data structure more in terms of efficiency, which I've admittedly struggled with in the past. The only real roadblock I felt was choosing the right ways to execute the syntax. I do think I understand data structures much more than I did before, and how to consider different ones for different tasks in applications. I've also been noticing my code become much cleaner and more organized thanks to the way I group lines and functions.
